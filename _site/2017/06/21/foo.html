<p>description: Continuous Delivery (CD) and regulatory compliance are two critically important ingredients in today’s connected organizations. CD enables you to move quickly and respond to change in an era where change is increasing at an exponential rate with no sign of slowing down. Regulatory compliance ensures that your organization takes the appropriate steps to follow applicable laws and appear to require adding burdensome processes and controls to your software development lifecycle. While they appear to be at odds with one another at first, they actually complement each other well. While maintaining, analyzing, confirming, and reporting on the status of required information security, compliance, and privacy controls can be difficult, integrating these tasks within your CD pipeline is easier than you think. Using examples from real-world projects in organizations just like yours, Brandon explains how to integrate compliance and reporting into your CD pipeline using tools you already know such as pair programming, Jenkins, Chef, Metasploit, and others, leading you to the regulatory promised land known as “Continuous Compliance”. slides:</p>
